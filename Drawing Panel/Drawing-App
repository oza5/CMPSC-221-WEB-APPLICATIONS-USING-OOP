Java 2D Drawing Application.The application will contain the following elements:

a) an Undo button to undo the last shape drawn.
b) a Clear button to clear all shapes from the drawing.
c) a combo box for selecting the shape to draw, a line, oval, or rectangle.
d) a checkbox which specifies if the shape should be filled or unfilled.
e) a checkbox to specify whether to paint using a gradient.
f) two JButtons that each show a JColorChooser dialog to allow the user to choose the first and second color in the gradient.
g) a text field for entering the Stroke width.
h) a text field for entering the Stroke dash length.
I) a checkbox for specifying whether to draw a dashed or solid line.
j) a JPanel on which the shapes are drawn.
k) a status bar JLabel at the bottom of the frame that displays the current location of the mouse on the draw panel.
 

If the user selects to draw with a gradient, set the Paint on the shape to be a gradient of the two colors chosen by the user. If the user does not chose to draw with a gradient, then Paint with a solid color of the 1st Color.

Note: When dragging the mouse to create a new shape, the shape should be drawn as the mouse is dragged.

Note: Do not use the NetBeans GUI generator for this assignment.
